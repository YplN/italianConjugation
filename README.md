The website may be long to load the first time; it is the time required to load all the verbs and their conjugations.

If the difficulty is set to Medium, you can only type letters that are in the correct answer and still available.


The verbs and conjugations (verbs.js) were scraped from [wiktionary](https://it.wiktionary.org/), some mistakes may have been made during the process.
